	<h2>The Thirty-Seven Practices of All the Bodhisattvas</h2>
<p><strong><em>by Gyalse Tokme Zangpo</em></strong></p>
<p><em>Namo LokeÅvaraye!</em></p>
<p>You see that all things are beyond coming and going,<br/>
Yet still you strive solely for the sake of living beingsâ<br/>
To you, my precious guru inseparable from Lord Avalokita,<br/>
I offer perpetual homage, respectfully, with body, speech and mind.</p>
<p>The perfect buddhas, who are the source of all benefit and joy,<br/>
Come into being through accomplishing the sacred Dharma.<br/>
And since this in turn depends on knowing how to practise,<br/>
I shall now describe the practices of all the buddhasâ heirs. </p>
<ol>
<li><p>The practice of all the bodhisattvas is to study, reflect and meditate,<br/>
Tirelessly, both day and night, without ever straying into idleness,<br/>
In order to free oneself and others from this ocean of saá¹sÄra,<br/>
Having gained this supreme vesselâa free, well-favoured human life, so difficult to find.</p></li>
<li><p>The practice of all the bodhisattvas is to leave behind oneâs homeland,<br/>
Where our attachment to family and friends overwhelms us like a torrent,<br/>
While our aversion towards enemies rages inside us like a blazing fire,<br/>
And delusionâs darkness obscures what must be adopted and abandoned.</p></li>
<li><p>The practice of all the bodhisattvas is to take to solitary places,<br/>
Avoiding the unwholesome, so that destructive emotions gradually fade away,<br/>
And, in the absence of distraction, virtuous practice naturally gains strength;<br/>
Whilst, with awareness clearly focused, we gain conviction in the teachings.</p></li>
<li><p>The practice of all the bodhisattvas is to renounce this lifeâs concerns,<br/>
For friends and relatives, long acquainted, must all go their separate ways;<br/>
Wealth and prized possessions, painstakingly acquired, must all be left behind;<br/>
And consciousness, the guest who lodges in the body, must in time depart.</p></li>
<li><p>The practice of all the bodhisattvas is to avoid destructive friends,<br/>
In whose company the three poisons of the mind grow stronger,<br/>
And we engage less and less in study, reflection and meditation,<br/>
So that love and compassion fade away until they are no more.</p></li>
<li><p>The practice of all the bodhisattvas is to cherish spiritual friends,<br/>
By regarding them as even more precious than oneâs own body,<br/>
Since they are the ones who will help to rid us of all our faults,<br/>
And make our virtues grow ever greater just like the waxing moon.</p></li>
<li><p>The practice of all the bodhisattvas is to take refuge in the Three Jewels,<br/>
Since they will never fail to provide protection for all who call upon them,<br/>
For whom are the ordinary gods of this world ever capable of helping,<br/>
As long as they themselves are trapped within saá¹sÄraâs vicious cycle?</p></li>
<li><p>The practice of all the bodhisattvas is never to commit a harmful act,<br/>
Even though not to do so might put oneâs very life at risk,<br/>
For the Sage himself has taught how negative actions will ripen<br/>
Into the manifold miseries of the lower realms, so difficult to endure.</p></li>
<li><p>The practice of all the bodhisattvas is to strive towards the goal,<br/>
Which is the supreme state of changeless, everlasting liberation,<br/>
Since all the happiness of the three realms lasts but a moment,<br/>
And then is quickly gone, just like dewdrops on blades of grass.</p></li>
<li><p>The practice of all the bodhisattvas is to arouse bodhicitta,<br/>
So as to bring freedom to all sentient beings, infinite in number.<br/>
For how can true happiness ever be found while our mothers,<br/>
Who have cared for us throughout the ages, endure such pain?</p></li>
<li><p>The practice of all the bodhisattvas is to make a genuine exchange<br/>
Of oneâs own happiness and wellbeing for all the sufferings of others.<br/>
Since all misery comes from seeking happiness for oneself alone,<br/>
Whilst perfect buddhahood is born from the wish for othersâ good.</p></li>
<li><p>Even if others, in the grips of great desire, should steal,<br/>
Or encourage others to take away, all the wealth that I possess,<br/>
To dedicate to them entirely my body, possessions and all my merits<br/>
From the past, present and futureâ this is the practice of all the bodhisattvas.</p></li>
<li><p>Even if others should seek to cut off my head,<br/>
Though Iâve done them not the slightest wrong,<br/>
To take upon myself, out of compassion,<br/>
All the harms they have amassedâthis is the practice of all the bodhisattvas.</p></li>
<li><p>Even if others should declare before the world<br/>
All manner of unpleasant things about me,<br/>
To speak only of their qualities in return,<br/>
With a mind thatâs filled with loveâthis is the practice of all the bodhisattvas.</p></li>
<li><p>Even if others should expose my hidden faults or deride me<br/>
When speaking amidst great gatherings of many people,<br/>
To conceive of them as spiritual friends and to bow<br/>
Before them in respectâthis is the practice of all the bodhisattvas.</p></li>
<li><p>Even if others whom I have cared for like children of my own<br/>
Should turn upon me and treat me as an enemy,<br/>
To regard them only with special fondness and affection,<br/>
As a mother would her ailing childâthis is the practice of all the bodhisattvas.</p></li>
<li><p>Even if others, equal or inferior to me in status,<br/>
Should, out of arrogance, disparage me,<br/>
To honour them, as I would my teacher,<br/>
By bowing down my head before themâthis is the practice of all the bodhisattvas.</p></li>
<li><p>Even though I may be destitute and despised by all,<br/>
Beset with terrible illness and plagued by evil spirits,<br/>
Still to take upon myself all beingsâ ills and harmful actions,<br/>
Without ever losing heartâthis is the practice of all the bodhisattvas.</p></li>
<li><p>Even though I may be famous and revered by all,<br/>
And as rich as VaiÅravaá¹a, the god of wealth himself,<br/>
To see the futility of all the glory and riches of this world<br/>
And to remain without conceitâthis is the practice of all the bodhisattvas.</p></li>
<li><p>The practice of all the bodhisattvas is to subdue the mind<br/>
With the forces of loving kindness and compassion.<br/>
For unless the real adversaryâmy own angerâis defeated,<br/>
Outer enemies, though I may conquer them, will continue to appear.</p></li>
<li><p>The practice of all the bodhisattvas is to turn away immediately<br/>
From those things which bring desire and attachment.<br/>
For the pleasures of the senses are just like salty water:<br/>
The more we taste of them, the more our thirst increases.</p></li>
<li><p>The practice of all the bodhisattvas is never to entertain concepts,<br/>
Which revolve around dualistic notions of perceiver and perceived,<br/>
In the knowledge that all these appearances are but the mind itself,<br/>
Whilst mindâs own nature is forever beyond the limitations of ideas.</p></li>
<li><p>The practice of all the bodhisattvas is to let go of grasping<br/>
When encountering things one finds pleasant or attractive,<br/>
Considering them to be like rainbows in the summer skiesâ<br/>
Beautiful in appearance, yet in truth devoid of any substance.</p></li>
<li><p>The practice of all the bodhisattvas is to recognize delusion<br/>
Whenever one is confronted by adversity or misfortune.<br/>
For these sufferings are just like the death of a child in a dream,<br/>
And itâs so exhausting to cling to delusory perceptions as real.</p></li>
<li><p>The practice of all the bodhisattvas is to give out of generosity,<br/>
With no hopes of karmic recompense or expectation of reward.<br/>
For if those who seek awakening must give even their own bodies,<br/>
What need is there to mention mere outer objects and possessions?</p></li>
<li><p>The practice of all the bodhisattvas is to observe ethical restraint,<br/>
Without the slightest intention of continuing in saá¹sÄric existence.<br/>
For lacking discipline one will never secure even oneâs own wellbeing,<br/>
And so any thought of bringing benefit to others would be absurd.</p></li>
<li><p>The practice of all the bodhisattvas is to cultivate patience,<br/>
Free from any trace of animosity towards anyone at all,<br/>
Since any potential source of harm is like a priceless treasure<br/>
To the bodhisattva who is eager to enjoy a wealth of virtue.</p></li>
<li><p>The practice of all the bodhisattvas is to strive with enthusiastic diligenceâ<br/>
The source of all good qualitiesâwhen working for the sake of all who live;<br/>
Seeing that even ÅrÄvakas and pratyekabuddhas, who labour for themselves alone,<br/>
Exert themselves as if urgently trying to extinguish fires upon their heads.</p></li>
<li><p>The practice of all the bodhisattvas is to cultivate concentration,<br/>
Which utterly transcends the four formless absorptions,<br/>
In the knowledge that mental afflictions are overcome entirely<br/>
Through penetrating insight suffused with stable calm.</p></li>
<li><p>The practice of all the bodhisattvas is to cultivate wisdom,<br/>
Beyond the three conceptual spheres, alongside skilful means,<br/>
Since it is not possible to attain the perfect level of awakening<br/>
Through the other five pÄramitÄs alone, in wisdomâs absence.</p></li>
<li><p>The practice of all the bodhisattvas is to scrutinize oneself<br/>
Continually and to rid oneself of faults whenever they appear.<br/>
For unless one checks carefully to find oneâs own confusion,<br/>
One might appear to be practising Dharma, but act against it.</p></li>
<li><p>The practice of all the bodhisattvas is never to speak ill<br/>
Of others who have embarked upon the greater vehicle,<br/>
For if, under the influence of destructive emotions,<br/>
I speak of other bodhisattvasâ failings, it is I who am at fault.</p></li>
<li><p>The practice of all the bodhisattvas is to let go of attachment<br/>
To the households of benefactors and of family and friends,<br/>
Since oneâs study, reflection and meditation will all diminish<br/>
When one quarrels and competes for honours and rewards.</p></li>
<li><p>The practice of all the bodhisattvas is to avoid harsh words,<br/>
Which others might find unpleasant or distasteful,<br/>
Since abusive language upsets the minds of others,<br/>
And thereby undermines a bodhisattvaâs conduct.</p></li>
<li><p>The practice of all the bodhisattvas is to slay attachment<br/>
And the restâmindâs afflictionsâat once, the very moment they arise,<br/>
Taking as weapons the remedies held with mindfulness and vigilance.<br/>
For once the kleshas have become familiar, theyâll be harder to avert.</p></li>
<li><p>In short, no matter what one might be doing,<br/>
By examining always the status of oneâs mind,<br/>
With continuous mindfulness and alertness,<br/>
To bring about the good of othersâthis is the practice of all the bodhisattvas.</p></li>
<li><p>The practice of all the bodhisattvas is to dedicate towards enlightenment<br/>
All the virtue to be gained through making effort in these ways,<br/>
With wisdom that is purified entirely of the three conceptual spheres,<br/>
So as to dispel the sufferings of the infinity of beings.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Here I have set down for those who wish to follow the bodhisattva path,<br/>
Thirty-seven practices to be adopted by all the buddhasâ heirs,<br/>
Based on what is taught in the sÅ«tras, tantras and treatises,<br/>
And following the instructions of the great masters of the past.</p>
<p>Since my intellect is only feeble and I have studied but a little,<br/>
This is not a composition likely to delight the connoisseurs,<br/>
Yet since Iâve relied upon the sÅ«tras and what the saints have taught<br/>
I feel these are indeed the genuine trainings of the buddhasâ heirs.</p>
<p>Still, the tremendous waves of activity of the bodhisattvas<br/>
Are difficult for simple-minded folk like me to comprehend,<br/>
And I must therefore beg the indulgence of all the perfect saints<br/>
For any contradictions, irrelevancies or other flaws this may contain.</p>
<p>Through whatever merit has here been gained, may all beings<br/>
Generate sublime bodhicitta, both relative and absolute,<br/>
And through this, come to equal Lord AvalokiteÅvara,<br/>
Transcending the extremes of existence and quiescence.</p>
<p><em>This was composed in Jewel Cave (Rinchen Puk) in Ngulchu by the monk Tokme, a teacher of scripture and reasoning, for his own and othersâ benefit.</em></p>
